- Issue: Get a shared key
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: public conversation to derive a secret shared key
	- Details
		- p: large prime
		- g: large primitive root modulo p
		- Eve knows: p, g, g^a mod p, g^b mod p
		- Eve wants to compute s(as the key) := g^ab mod p 
	- Defending against MITM
		- Trust-on-first-use
		- Have users communicate out-of-band
		- Rely on proximity to limit MITMs
		- Use digital signatures
		- Forward Security: allows temporary session key to communicate repeatedly
- RSA: Public-key cryptography
	- RSA can be used for confidentiality, integrity, and/or authenticity
	- RSA drawbacks:
		- 1000X slower than AES
		- Messages must be shorter than N 
		- Keys must be relatively huge
	- Attacks on Textbook RSA
		- Small e attack
		- Stereotyped message attacks
		- Forging signatures on random/specific messages
