- Keep the content of message *p* secret from an eavesdropper
- Caesar Cipher
	- Replace each plaintext letter with one a fixed  number of places down the alphabet
- Vig√®nere cipher
	- Encrypts successive letters using a sequence of  Caesar ciphers keyed by the letters of a keyword
	- How to find n? One way: Kasiski method
- One-time Pad (OTP)
	- share a secret, very long string of random bits k, encrypt and decrypt with XOR
	- provably secure, usually impractical
	- never use any part of the pad
- Stream Cipher: Use #PRG
	- Use #PRF , random input as key
	- Insecure: RC4
	- Secure: ChaCha20
- Block Cipher
	- Consist of function that encyrpts fixed-size (n-bit) blocks with a resuable key k
	- PRP (psudorandom permutation): has inverse
	- [[AES]]
	- Encrypting arbitrary-sized messages:
		- Padding: add byte to end of message to make it a multiple of block size
		- Cipher modes: algorithms for applying block ciphers to more than one block
			- Encrypted codebook (ECB): **FLAWED**: same plaintext encrypt to same ciphertext
			- Cipher-block chaining ([[CBC]]) mode
				- ![[Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 1.29.07 AM.png]]
			- Counter ([[CTR]]) mode
				- Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher
				- Doesn't requre padding, efficient parallelism/ramdom access
