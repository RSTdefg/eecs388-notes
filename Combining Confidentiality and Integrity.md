- Encryption methods are malleable: can transform a ciphertext into another ciphertext that decrypts to a related plaintext
	- [[CBC]]: Flipping bits in ciphertext block i will:  completely corrupt decrypted block i, flip corresponding bits in decrypted block i+1
	- [[CTR]]: Flipping bits anywhere in the ciphertext will flip corresponding bits in decrypted plaintext
- MAC-then-Encrypt:
	- with CBC mode, susceptible to CBC [[Padding Oracles]]
- Encrypt then MAC:
	- AEAD: Integrity and encryption in a single primitive
- Key Sizes:
	- For ciphers/PRGs:  
		- 128 bits considered “classically” safe  
		- For quantum-resistance, use 256 bits  
	- For MACs/PRFs:  
		- Want collision resistance  
		- Output should be 2X size of cipher keys 
		- e.g., use HMAC-SHA256 with AES-128
