- Attacker Capabilities:
	- Physical access
	- In path: Attacker can see, add, and block packets
	- On path: On path: Attacker can see and add packets, but cannot block packets
	- Passive: can see, not modify
	- Off path: cannot see network traffic of the victim
- ARP Spoofing:
	- Fastest responder generally wins
- IP Protocol Network Layer Threats:
	- Packets have a non-cryptographic checksum
	- Packets offer no authentication, source set by sender
	- Can set arbitrary destination address, network scanning
- BGP Threats:
	- BGP has no authentication — possible to announce someone else’s network → BGP hijacking
	- Defense: RPKI
- TCP Connection Spoofing:
	- Off-path attacker can send initial SYN to  server ...  ... but cannot complete three-way  handshake without seeing the server’s  sequence number  
	- 1 in 232 chance to guess right if initial sequence number chosen uniformly at random
- TCP Reset Attack
- Protecting DNS
	- Authoritative DNS servers sign DNS  responses
	- DNSSEC does not encrypt communications. DNS over TLS or HTTPS, on the other hand, does  encrypt DNS queries.
