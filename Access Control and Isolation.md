- Security Model
	- subjects: who - UNIX: users- Android: apps- Web: origins
	- objects: what- UNIX: files, processes, devices- Other: db tables, cookies, device sensors, etc.
- Security Policy:
	- access control matrix that maps subjects and objects to allowed operations
- Principle of least Privilage: every program and user should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete its job
- Principle of Complete Mediation:
	- every access to every object must be checked for authority by a mediator
	- Be careful of caching checks: if change in authority occurs, cached results must be updated, otherwise may be time-of-check, time-of-use vulnerabilities
- UNIX Security Model:
	- Users and groups: username, user id, belong to several groups, superusers
	- File permissions: file permission bits: owner--group--others
	- Processes: EUID: determines permissions of that process, inherit user and group of their parent process, can be changed by root
- Process Isolation:
	- be skeptical of all programs, isolate to achieve least privilege
	- general goal: confinement: ensure misbehaving process cannot harm rest of system
- Design: Reference monitor
	- Mediates requests from applications
	- Must always be invoked, must be tamperproof
- chroot "jails", simple isolation mechanism provided by UNIX kernel
	- Application cannot access files outside of jail because it cannot even name them
- Ways to evade chroot isolation
	- Create device that lets you access raw disk, Send signals to non-chrooted process, reboot
- System call interposition: monitor system calls and block unauthorized calls
	- ptrace: process tracing, monitor checks policy, kills application if request is disallowed
	- difficulty choosing policy for specific apps
- Containers:
	- confinement at the level of the operating system, which creates multiple isolated userspace instances, on the same os, kernel
- Virtural machine
	- emulate the entire computer, OS and all
	- mediation provided by virtual machine monitor, hypervisor
	- safety: malware can infect guest OS, cannot escape from the infected VM
		- requires that VMM itself is not buggy
- Covert channel: unintended communication channel between isolated components
- Side Channels: leakage channel between isolated components
